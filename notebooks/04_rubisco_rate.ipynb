    "# Estimating the average rate of rubisco in the wild\n",
    "After estimating the total mass of rubisco in the notebook [**```rubisco_mass_estimate.ipynb```**](rubisco_mass_estimate.ipynb), we can use this estimate in order to estimate the average rate of rubisco in the wild, both in the terrestrial and marine environments. We use estimate of the global terrestrial annual rate of carbon fixation, the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and convert it to a rate in units of moles of carbon fixed per second. For the terrestrial environment, we our estimate of the global terrestrial GPP is based on [Beer et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1184984), which estimated it at ≈120 Gt C yr$^{-1}$. We note that the exact value of the global GPP is still debated, it is estimated to be accurate to better than 2 fold (Welp et al. 2011), which for the purposes of our analysis is accurate enough."
